<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This collection of comments is by no means comprehensive, but represents
select perspectives from the community that we hope NIST will consider in its
Digital Identity Guidelines. Many of the comments are synthesized from the
artifacts and comments in the following GitHub issue thread:</p>

<h1>Comments by Topic in "Note to Reviewers"</h1>
<p><b>Privacy enhancements and considerations for identity proofing, authentication,
and federation, including new developments in techniques to limit linkability
and observability for federation.</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a>
  have authentication required as a
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-use-cases/#authenticate">core DID
  Action</a>. This means that the authentication follows the identifier instead
  of necessarily being determined by the system, reducing the implementation
  effort overall if there are DID Methods are appropriate for the use case.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>
  can be relied upon by verifiers for authentication, and this use case enables
  a model where a separate trusted party can perform authentication in an
  interoperable fashion. See the example in the next section with SMS.</li>
  <li>See the comments for Section 8.1.1 for a usage example with Social
  Security Numbers</li>
  <li>Recent advancements in the community using zero-knowledge proofs with
  Verifiable Credentials have enabled selective disclosure functionality,
  using the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020">BBS+ and
  Linked Data formats</a>. This has significant privacy preserving and
  observability implications, allowing credential holders to present only
  relevant aspects of their credentials in a cryptographically secure
  manner.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Continued use of short message service (SMS) and public switched telephone
networks (PSTN) as restricted authentication channels for out-of-band
authenticators.</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Verifiable Credentials can assist with interoperability of existing SMS and PSTN
  authentication channels by providing means to package attestations, such as,
  for example, that a user can receive SMS messages at a specific phone number, in
  a standardized web-friendly format that is cryptographically verifiable. This
  approach enables further modularity at two critical junctures:
    <ol>
      <li>The issuers of these authentication data do not have to be the same
          parties as the service being accessed; the standards imply an
          interoperable way to package this so a single entity can securely
          perform authentication on behalf of many others.
      </li>
      <li>With a generic way to package reliable authentication information,
          we can prepare existing systems to accept non-SMS/PSTN based
          authentication channels with minimal disruption.
      </li>
    </ol>

  </li>
  <li>We believe that Verifiable Credentials should be considered as a
      recommended path forward to reducing switching costs into new forms of
      digital format-based authentication with improved security profiles.
  </li>
  <li>Additional verification is often helpful. For example, an important case
      in healthcare is to verify an insurance ID where the incentive is getting
      paid. There may be a subtle difference between verification of the
      identifier and authentication of the identity. Verifiable Credentials
      provide means to make this distinction.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Security and performance capabilities (e.g., presentation attack
detection/liveness testing) for biometric characteristic collection to
support Identity Assurance Level 2 remote identity proofing in the areas of
identity evidence verification (physical/biometric comparison) or binding of
authenticators.</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>The use of biometric characteristics in conjunction with Verifiable
      Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers has not yet been fully
      explored. It has significant user privacy concerns that must be
      appropriately addressed prior to issuing community responses. Progress on
      the PING Self-Review for privacy in the DID Working Group can be found
      <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/291">here</a>. There is
      currently no specific work item for biometrics and Verifiable Credentials
      or Decentralized Identifiers at W3C CCG.</li>

  <li>Verifiable Credentials can enable a way for verifiers to authenticate
      themselves to a credential holders prior to presentation.</li>
  <li>Decentralized Identifiers with the appropriate authentication flows
      can allow credential holders to establish authenticity of the
      verifier.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Additional controls and mitigation to address the ongoing evolution of
threats such as phishing and automated attacks.</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>The DIDComm messaging protocol is being designed with consideration of
        ways to mitigate automated attacks by increasing the cost of attack,
        such as in 
        <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging/issues/66">this issue thread</a>. 
        We believe it should be considered as a tool to address phishing and
        automated attacks.</li>

    <h3>Section 8.1.1 Social Security Numbers</h3>
    <q>...Overreliance on the SSN can contribute to misuse and place the
        applicant at risk of harm, such as through identity theft. Nonetheless,
        ....</q>
    <h4>Comments</h4> 
    <p>For some use cases, when Privacy concern is high, one time use of
    Decentralized Identifiers or derivative artifacts may be considered for use
    as unique alternative identifiers to the SSN. For further privacy, the
    pairwise DID identifiers can be used. The DID is meaningless by itself, but
    globally unique. It has the potential to mitigate correlation risks.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, DID-based systems should prevent DIDs from being used for
    authentication, so the harm in public exposure is reduced. The same DID
    has the potential to be used across systems, agencies, and organizations
    without compromising its security and privacy properties.</p>

  <h2>Document 800-63-B</h2>
    <section>
    <h3>Section 9.3: Use Limitation</h3>
      <q>...CSPs may have various business purposes for processing
      attributes, including providing non-identity services to subscribers.
      However, processing attributes for other purposes than those specified at
      collection can create privacy risks when individuals are not expecting or
      comfortable with the additional processing. CSPs can determine
      appropriate measures commensurate with the privacy risk arising from the
      additional processing. For example, absent applicable law, regulation or
      policy, it may not be necessary to get consent when processing attributes
      to provide non-identity services requested by subscribers, although
      notices may help subscribers maintain reliable assumptions about the
      processing (predictability). Other processing of attributes may carry
      different privacy risks that call for obtaining consent or allowing
      subscribers more control over the use or disclosure of specific
      attributes (manageability). Subscriber consent needs to be meaningful;
      therefore, as stated in Section 4.4, when CSPs use consent measures,
      acceptance by the subscriber of additional uses SHALL NOT be a condition
      of providing authentication services.</q>
      <h4>Comments</h4>
      <p> In some use cases, Selective Disclosure and Zero-Knowledge Proofs
      with Verifiable Credentials can be leveraged when individuals wish to
      utilize information minimization.</p>
