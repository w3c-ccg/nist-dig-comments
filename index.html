<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This collection of comments is by no means comprehensive, but represents
select perspectives from the community that we hope NIST will consider in its
Digital Identity Guidelines. Many of the comments are synthesized from the
artifacts and comments in the following GitHub issue thread:</p>
<a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/145">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/145</a>

<p>Most of all, these comments are meant to begin dialog and discussion with
respect to the NIST Digital Identity Guidelines. They are not meant to be a
final and definitive community stance, but an opportunity to begin engagement
with government technologists and state-sponsored standards developing
organizations including NIST and its affiliates.</p>

<h1>Comments by Topic in "Note to Reviewers"</h1>
<p><b>Privacy enhancements and considerations for identity proofing, authentication,
and federation, including new developments in techniques to limit linkability
and observability for federation.</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a>
  have authentication required as a
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-use-cases/#authenticate">core DID
  Action</a>. This means that the authentication follows the identifier instead
  of necessarily being determined by the system, reducing the implementation
  effort overall if there are DID Methods are appropriate for the use case.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>
  can be relied upon by verifiers for authentication, and this use case enables
  a model where a separate trusted party can perform authentication in an
  interoperable fashion. See the example in the next section with SMS.</li>
  <li>See the comments for Section 8.1.1 for a usage example with Social
  Security Numbers</li>
  <li>Recent advancements in the community using zero-knowledge proofs with
  Verifiable Credentials have enabled selective disclosure functionality,
  using the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020">BBS+ and
  Linked Data formats</a>. This has significant privacy preserving and
  observability implications, allowing credential holders to present only
  relevant aspects of their credentials in a cryptographically secure
  manner.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Continued use of short message service (SMS) and public switched telephone
networks (PSTN) as restricted authentication channels for out-of-band
authenticators.</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Verifiable Credentials can assist with interoperability of existing SMS and PSTN
  authentication channels by providing means to package attestations, such as,
  for example, that a user can receive SMS messages at a specific phone number, in
  a standardized web-friendly format that is cryptographically verifiable. This
  approach enables further modularity at two critical junctures:
    <ol>
      <li>The issuers of these authentication data do not have to be the same
          parties as the service being accessed; the standards imply an
          interoperable way to package this so a single entity can securely
          perform authentication on behalf of many others.
      </li>
      <li>With a generic way to package reliable authentication information,
          we can prepare existing systems to accept non-SMS/PSTN based
          authentication channels with minimal disruption.
      </li>
    </ol>

  </li>
  <li>We believe that Verifiable Credentials should be considered as a
      recommended path forward to reducing switching costs into new forms of
      digital format-based authentication with improved security profiles.
  </li>
  <li>Additional verification is often helpful. For example, an important case
      in healthcare is to verify an insurance ID where the incentive is getting
      paid. There may be a subtle difference between verification of the
      identifier and authentication of the identity. Verifiable Credentials
      provide means to make this distinction.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Security and performance capabilities (e.g., presentation attack
detection/liveness testing) for biometric characteristic collection to
support Identity Assurance Level 2 remote identity proofing in the areas of
identity evidence verification (physical/biometric comparison) or binding of
authenticators.</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>The use of biometric characteristics in conjunction with Verifiable
      Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers has not yet been fully
      explored. It has significant user privacy concerns that must be
      appropriately addressed prior to issuing community responses. Progress on
      the PING Self-Review for privacy in the DID Working Group can be found
      <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/291">here</a>. There is
      currently no specific work item for biometrics and Verifiable Credentials
      or Decentralized Identifiers at W3C CCG.</li>
  <li>Elsewhere in the decentralized identity community, during Rebooting Web
      of Trust 6, community members have created
      <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot6-santabarbara/blob/master/draft-documents/Biometrics.md">a draft of their approach to biometrics</a>.</li>

<p><b>Capabilities and security considerations for verifier impersonation
resistance (see SP 800-63B FAQ B04).</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Verifiable Credentials can enable a way for verifiers to authenticate
      themselves to a credential holders prior to presentation.</li>
  <li>Decentralized Identifiers with the appropriate authentication flows
      can allow credential holders to establish authenticity of the
      verifier.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Additional controls and mitigation to address the ongoing evolution of
threats such as phishing and automated attacks.</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>The DIDComm messaging protocol is being designed with consideration of
        ways to mitigate automated attacks by increasing the cost of attack,
        such as in 
        <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging/issues/66">this issue thread</a>. 
        We believe it should be considered as a tool to address phishing and
        automated attacks.</li>

  <h2>Document 800-63-3: Digital Identity Guidelines</h2>
    <section>
    <h3>General Comments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The rules should clarify how the guidelines interface with trust
          frameworks that develop (for example, in a particular industry or
          domain and which some government agencies may wish to be apart),
          particularly in light of the increasing interaction between public and
          private sector.</li>
      <li>The guidelines could address issues regarding a relying party’s right
          to rely. This might include, for example, a relying party’s right to
          rely on an identity credential generally or rely on credentials
          issued under a certain trust framework.</li>
      <li>NIST could ensure that the rules do not discriminate among IdM system
          models by including the concept of IdM system neutrality. Because (as
          the current version recognises at the beginning) there are many
          different ways of conducting online identity transactions (e.g., single
          identity provider (IdP) systems, federated (multiple IdP) systems, user
          controlled/user centric systems/self-sovereign systems, hub systems,
          DLT systems, etc.), it is important that the rules do not require or
          assume a particular approach to the identification and/or
          authentication processes, or the system that delivers them. The
          guidelines should consider ways to ensure that Rules do not (regardless
          of the introductory disclaimers made) imply and/or require a certain
          system model.</li>
      <li>The Rules do not comment on standard allocation of liability. This is
          likely deliberate – eg. due to the public sector focus of the rules, or
          diversity of IdM systems such that it would be inappropriate to impose
          a one-size-fits-all approach. However, liability may be addressed in
          trust frameworks. In many cases, private sector digital identity
          participants rely on attribute assertions from third parties, such as
          national IdM systems or other government databases (e.g., DMV). Since
          government IdM systems are often viewed as authoritative, they will not
          typically accept any liability for errors.  Therefore determining who
          bears the loss in the case of errors in government supplied information
          is vital. The rules should address ways in which these obligations and
          liability allocation might be appropriately resolved.
      </li>
      <li>The NIST Guidelines could set out a process for certifying Trust
          Framework bodies for certain use-cases/communities which meet NIST
          guidelines.</li>
      <li>(Abstract) “These guidelines provide technical requirements for
        federal agencies implementing digital identity services and are not
        intended to constrain the development or use of standards outside of
        this purpose.” – As above, federal agencies are likely to increasingly
        interact with a more diverse identity eco-system moving forwards which
        will include customers who have been issued and wish to reuse identity
        credentials issued by non-federal agencies. The guidelines should
        address this reality and take into account models other than the
        federated approach.</li>
    </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h3>Comments by Section</h3>
    <b>Section 2</b>
    <q>This recommendation also provides guidelines for credential service providers (CSPs), verifiers, and relying parties (RPs)</q>
    <p>The framing throughout the rules (for example, the roles) fits/assumes
    the traditional IdM system model. IdM system models are undergoing a
    variety of changes and experimentation, raising concerns that using this
    list of obligations is based on an old model, that may not fit newer IdM
    systems and/or may unduly inhibit further experimentation.</p>

    <b>Section 4.1</b>
    <q>The digital identity model used in these guidelines reflects
    technologies and architectures currently available in the market</q>
    <p>Some SSI technologies are in market – are the guidelines intended to
    cover SSI technologies?</p>

    <q>When a claimant successfully demonstrates possession and control of one
      or more authenticators to a verifier through an authentication protocol,
      the verifier can verify that the claimant is a valid subscriber. The
      verifier passes on an assertion about the subscriber, who maybe either
      pseudonymous or non-pseudonymous, to the RP</q>
    <p>In SSI, the role of the verifier is not required – or rather it is
    replaced by digital wallet component that acts on behalf of the
    subject.</p>

    <b>Section 4.1 Figure 4-1</b>
    <p>This is only one type of digital identity model – it is not
    representative of non-federated models.</p>

    <b>Section 4.3.2</b>
    <q>A credential is stored and maintained by the CSP, though the claimant
      may possess it</q>
    <p>Why isn’t the credential is stored where the user chooses – eg in the
    user’s digital wallet and backed up.</p>

    <b>Section 4.4</b>
    <q>Overall, SP 800-63 does not presuppose a federated identity
    architecture</q>
    <p>The roles depicted and language used do predicate a federated model. It
    would be difficult to adopt an SSI model AND adhere to the NIST digital
    identity guidelines.</p>
    <p>The section sets out the benefits of a federated architecture over a
    siloed one, but there is no reference to or comparison to a decentralised
    model.</p>

    <b>Section 4.4.1 Assertions</b>
    <q>An RP trusts an assertion based on the source, the time of creation, how
      long the assertion is valid from time of creation, and the corresponding
      trust framework that governs the policies and processes of CSPs and RPs.
    </q>
    <p>NIST could clarify how trust frameworks interface with these guidelines.
    </p>
    
    <q>Examples of assertions include: (SAML, OIDC, Kerberos tickets)</q>
    <p>Verifiable credentials can also be containers for assertions.</p>

    <b>Table 5.3 Federation Assurance Levels</b>
    <q>FAL1: permits the RP to receive a bearer assertion from an identity
       provider (IdP). The IdP must sign the assertion using approved
       cryptography.</q>
    <p>Can the digital wallet be the IdP in this context?</p>

    <b>Section 6.1</b>
    <q>...more information on whether an agency can federate is provided in
    section 7</q>
    <p>What about more information on self-federation?</p>

    </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h3>Comments by Section</h3>
    <b>Section 4.1 Process Flow</b>
    <q>The CSP validates the information by checking an authoritative source</q>
    <p>What if the information an  applicant receives from the authoritative
    source is already signed by them? Eg. in SSI where a credential is
    cryptographically signed by the issuer and does not need to be validated by
    a CSP for a relying party to rely on it.</p>

    <b>Section 4.4 Identity Assurance Level 2</b>
    <p>The framing assumes that a CSP is present, when this role is not always
    necessary – eg. if the individual has their credentials issued to them
    directly by the issuer, they can present these to a relying party without
    the need for a CSP to be involved.  </p>

    <b>Section 4.4.1.6 Address Confirmation</b>
    <p>If a utilities company provided a proof of address credentials (eg.
    because internet was connected at the address and paid for by the
    applicant), would this be an acceptable form of address confirmation?</p>

    <b>Section 5.3.2</b>
    <p>Large focus on Knowledge Based Verification requirements – what about
    guidelines for “something you have”?</p>

    <b>Section 8.1.1 Social Security Numbers</b>
    <q>...Overreliance on the SSN can contribute to misuse and place the
        applicant at risk of harm, such as through identity theft. Nonetheless,
        ....</q>
    <p>For some use cases, when Privacy concern is high, one time use of
    Decentralized Identifiers or derivative artifacts may be considered for use
    as unique alternative identifiers to the SSN. For further privacy, the
    pairwise DID identifiers can be used. The DID is meaningless by itself, but
    globally unique. It has the potential to mitigate correlation risks.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, DID-based systems should prevent DIDs from being used for
    authentication, so the harm in public exposure is reduced. The same DID
    has the potential to be used across systems, agencies, and organizations
    without compromising its security and privacy properties.</p>

  <h2>Document 800-63-B: Authentication and Lifecycle Management</h2>
    <section>
    <h3>General Comments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We prioritize the idea of authentication based on something you have
        rather than something you know</li>
      <li>Innovations in DID, especially ephemeral DIDs, would add
        privacy-preserving properties.</li>
    </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h3>Comments by Section</h3>
    <b>Section 9.3 Use Limitation</b>
    <q>...CSPs may have various business purposes for processing
    attributes, including providing non-identity services to subscribers.
    However, processing attributes for other purposes than those specified at
    collection can create privacy risks when individuals are not expecting or
    comfortable with the additional processing.</q>
    <p>In some use cases, Selective Disclosure and Zero-Knowledge Proofs with
    Verifiable Credentials can be leveraged when individuals wish to utilize
    information minimization.</p>

  <h2>Document 800-63-C: Federation and Assertions</h2>
    <section>
    <h3>General Comments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The guidelines refer to the IdP – the guidelines should clarify
        whether an SSI based mobile wallet could be the ‘IdP’ or ‘federator’ in
        this context.</li>
      <li>Could consider including a new mechanism for federation that is based
        on SSI or decentralized technology</li>

    <section>
    <h3>Comments by Section</h3>
    <b>Figure 5</b>
    <p>Figure 5 talks about federation as a three party relationship which
    includes an IdP – again, the guidelines should clarify the terminology on
    what amounts to an IdP and whether this could be a digital wallet/software
    agent acting on behalf of the user.</p>
